Hello, my name is Hamish. I recently completed masters in Statistics at UNSW. My thesis was on the application of self-supervised learning to cancer image classification. My undergraduate was in psychology and mathematics with a minor in logic and philosophy of science.

Currently I am working on AI alignment, to reduce existential risk.
